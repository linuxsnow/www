## Why Skip SNOW?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Immutable /usr" icon="seti:folder">
		If you can't see around `apt-get` and `dnf` to install packages, SNOW is not for you.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Stable Debian Base" icon="seti:shell">
		If you need bleeding edge software, you'll have to put it in a container or VM. *We protect you from the cuts.*
	</Card>
	<Card title="Containers and Virtualization" icon="seti:config">
		If your whole system is a pet, SNOW is not for you.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Built for Developers" icon="seti:html">
		You might have to get your hands dirty to do complex things. The good news is, SNOW has you covered. You can't break the base.
	</Card>
